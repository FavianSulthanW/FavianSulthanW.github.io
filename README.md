# Hello!
I'm Sulthan, a penultimate-year statistics undergraduate student with a passion for the world of data science and data analytics. I have completed several projects in this field, primarily using Python and R, which are showcased here. I'm also currently learning more about Machine Learning.

#### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, R, Tableau, SPSS, E-Views


## Education

- Bachelor's Degree, Statistics | Universitas Indonesia (_July 2021-Present_)

This is one of my classes that i took in my 5th semester. Here's the summary of the projects that i did:
- Analyzed real hoax text dataset from [mafindo](https://www.mafindo.or.id/), made a text classification model with the highest accuracy, did some exploratory data analysis(EDA), and text analysis using [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/) to gain insights and giving recommandations from it.
- Analyzed real property dataset from various property websites in Indonesia, gaining important insights using EDA and giving recommendations from it.
- For my midterm test, we were given a dataset of mathematics departement alumni. We were told to gain 3 most important insights. I did EDA with visualizations and made a regression model to check the relationship between variables.

On my semester break, i took Kalbe Nutritionals - Data Scientist Virtual Internship from [Rakamin](https://www.rakamin.com/) the internship lasts for a month. Here's what i did:
- Developed a robust forecasting and clustering machine learning model using more than 5.000+ data
to create customer segmentation for marketing team and to predict the quantity of products sold 
daily for inventory team using Python, and SQL.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify highest selling products and stores and the quantity 
of products sold.


### Metode Peramalan

This is one of my classes that i took in my 4th semester. Here's what i did:
- For my final exam, we had a group project to forecast using ARIMA model. We predicted the daily temperature of Warsaw using this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateuszk013/warsaw-daily-weather) using ARIMA forecasting model in R


### Analisis Survival

This is also one of my classes that i took in my 4th semester. Here's what i did:
- For my final exam, we had a group project to apply the Cox-PH regression model to a survival dataset. We used primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) [dataset](https://pmagunia.com/dataset/r-dataset-package-survival-pbc) which is a type liver disease with severity stages. Using Cox-PH regression model we can see how different stages affect the survival of the patient.
